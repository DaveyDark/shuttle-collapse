# shuttle-collapse
My entry for the pygame community easter game jam. It's about saving your ship's core by destroying incoming debris. Made in pygame with all assets made by me. Completed in 4 days(7 days jam but I joined late). My first pygame game apart from a learner's project

To play,dowload the windows executable package from dust/shuttle-cllapse-win.zip
For other platforms,download source and execute "py main.py"
Python install needed for this step

Controls:

-W to jump and A or D to go left or right

-Left click to shoot,click left area of screen to schoot left and vice versa

-Right click to swiych firing modes


Help:

-Full auto fire deals high damage at close range but has a high reload time

-Semi auto deals very high damage over range but very little up close, it fires instantly without reload

-stop the boulders from reaching your ship core. If 5 boulders crash into the core or you come under a boulder,the game ends
